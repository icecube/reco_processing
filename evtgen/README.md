# Event-Generator reco

## versions

- v0: 100 files of 22635 and 100 files of 22634 of v1 of taupede reco.
- v1: 2000 files of all datasets from v2 Taupede reco
- v2: 4k per flavor of v5 reco
- v3: try to combine seeds, see which is best of the 3. Seems I will be running Combined and Max.
  - medangres_len: Max poorest, Thijs and Combined competitive with Taupede
  - medangres: Max poorest, Thijs and Combined competitive with Taupede except at the highest highest energy
  - medasmres_len: Combined seems to be the best, but at low lengths perhaps the median of Max is better.
  - energy reconstruction is bogus
  - medlenres_len: again, combined seems best, but median at low lengths seems to prefer Max.
  - NuE: Max seems to be best at small lengths for NuE
