I am making an inventory of how many simulated events Neha had, and how much I have. 

I do some checks to check if my hdf5 files match those of Neha, yes they do, except for the muons. Those I study in missing_muons.ipynb. Conclusion, my hdf script doesnt work for the muon files: fensurecc has problems creating the cc object. It is time I make my own hdf script in the future. For now its fine, do I really care about those 19 muon events?

For the rest, we have similar snowstorm ensemble events, but a factor 3-4 more baseline events. This is good news!
